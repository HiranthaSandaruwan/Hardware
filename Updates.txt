I want to do a little change in the current system after registration Customer can sent new request and admin has to approve it to appear it to the technicians I want to change that part and remove all every thing that useless with that method new method is after the registration Customer can send new request for a appointment and then the technicians can see those appointments. Admin interaction is of limit on that part so admin don't have to approve or anything to do there so remove that part also from our existing system. 
In the Customer means user Customer can request for a appointment and those request can assign by the technicians So we can remove proposal Panel from the user.

Technician Interface Their should be a dashboard, Appointment panel to assign customer requests, their they can assign a pending request and send customer a request with available time slot. these should be done with in a same page. then after that customer accept the appointment there should be a another panel to like Accepted Appointment they technician can update all the states regarding the repair process even payment feed backs are shows in that page receipt every thing I said.


Scenario,
I'm a customer I go to the site and register after the approval of the admin I login to the system I can see my dashboard in that dashboard. I can  send new request regarding my problem. then the technician can it under a pending Appointment panel to assign customer request. their technician send the available time slot. now the customer can see that request in the dashboard and customer will choice the time slot and update send to the technician. now technician can see that upcoming appointment and once technician received the device can update the status to received and then if the device still pending for repair, Repair in Progress, Done or else can't fix add necessary statuses) user can see these in their own tracker  and if it's fixed then they can update the status as Completed and if competed in the tracking panel their will be a URL to go to a different panel to see the receipt. and the technicians can fill a form to create the receipt after completed the work when they updated the status to complete they can go to different panel to fill that receipt that send back to he customer. And customer can pay their online or cash (cash mean when getting the device form the technician) (science we're not able to use payment gate way kind a things do not use them just show a option for a online payment or cash like I said ) then the customer will update that payment and technician can see it in the same panel that updated the completed status and after if customer paid online shows to the technician that paid other wise show other method. after the customer received their device technician will updated it and then that part is over a summary of that will goes to another panel and also same for the customer their will be a another panel for completed once. after all of this Admin can see the final summary or report in a different panel in their dashboard. else, a customer fail to pay or fill to reach out get their device after completed the repair technician can put it onhold and customer will see it in the tracking panel if the late it can be change after customer paid it or get their item form the technician. else, a customer fail to bring the device to the technician after accept the appointment for that certain date then the technician can reject it. and customer will see the status of that as rejected and will have to request a appointment again. Both technician and customer can give feedback to both sides and technician can rate the customer relation in the completing process customer can give feed back in their completed panel. Admin can see these rating in a separate panel (it would be more clear if we show customers and technicians separately in separate pages) Admin Admin have authority to remove access both customers and admins if needed! I would like if we arrange separate folders for admin customer technician for they pages it will be more clear in the editing process we may have to update the our database including all and using simple pure MySQL CSS JS PHP HTML to understand anyone
use the same panel for tacking purposes of each sides

bro got it — we’ll remove admin approval for requests and keep admin approval for registrations only. below is the clean, simple plan you can paste into Copilot and use to modify your current project (pure PHP/MySQL/JS/HTML/CSS; still keep default uoc/uoc user per spec)
. it’s fully aligned with our previous README approach (plain passwords, simple validation)

.
v2 flow (no admin approval for requests)
roles

    Admin: approve/reject registrations only; manage users (disable), view reports/summary, see feedback lists.

    Customer (User): register → wait for admin approval → login → create appointment request → view & accept a technician’s proposed slot → track statuses → pay (record only) → feedback.

    Technician: see all pending customer requests immediately → on the same page assign request and propose up to 3 time slots → see Accepted Appointments panel → mark Device Received / No-Show → update repair status → create receipt → see payment status → mark Returned → leave feedback.

states (simple)

    request lifecycle: New (customer) → Assigned (tech proposed slots) → Scheduled (customer accepted) → Device Received → In Progress → Completed → Returned

    side paths: Cannot Fix, On Hold, No-Show, Rejected (didn’t bring device).

what to change in codebase
remove

    any admin approval step for requests (buttons, columns, pages).

    customer proposal panel (user doesn’t propose; only technicians do).

    any visibility filter that hides new requests from technicians until admin approves.

keep

    admin approval for registrations (login allowed only if status='approved').

    spec pages: Login, Home/Dashboard, Admin, Features, Help; default user uoc/uoc

.

plain text passwords / simple validation as in your current README

database changes (minimal + pure MySQL)
if you already have the earlier schema I proposed, run these ALTERs to switch to v2

-- 1) REQUESTS: remove admin gate; track assignment + simple state
ALTER TABLE requests
  DROP COLUMN admin_status,                -- remove admin approval for requests
  ADD COLUMN assigned_to INT NULL AFTER user_id,   -- technician_id (who proposed/handles)
  ADD COLUMN state ENUM('New','Assigned','Scheduled','Device Received','In Progress','Completed','Returned','Cannot Fix','On Hold','No-Show','Rejected') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'New' AFTER description,
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_requests_assigned_to FOREIGN KEY (assigned_to) REFERENCES users(user_id);

-- 2) APPOINTMENT PROPOSALS: keep (created by TECH only), customer accepts ONE
-- if you already have table, ensure structure matches:
-- proposal links to request + technician; 1..3 slots; status per proposal
-- (no change needed if you used same design earlier)

-- 3) APPOINTMENTS: final chosen slot after customer accepts
-- (unchanged if you already have it)

-- 4) optional: add 'returned_at' for clarity
ALTER TABLE appointments
  ADD COLUMN returned_at DATETIME NULL AFTER no_show;

-- 5) REPAIR UPDATES / RECEIPTS / PAYMENTS / FEEDBACK remain as before
-- If missing, create exactly as defined previously (simple columns, no triggers).

if you don’t have my earlier tables yet, create the core v2 set quickly

minimal controller logic (copy-paste guards)

    login gate: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=? AND password=? AND status='approved' AND is_disabled=0

    technician page guard: $_SESSION['role']==='technician'

    admin page guard: $_SESSION['role']==='admin'

    customer new request: insert into requests with state='New'

    tech assign + propose (same page):

        set requests.assigned_to = $_SESSION['user_id']; requests.state='Assigned'

        insert into appointment_proposals with up to 3 slots

    customer accept slot:

        insert into appointments (chosen_slot)

        update proposal status='Accepted' (others Rejected)

        update requests.state='Scheduled'

    device received: set appointments.device_received=1; requests.state='Device Received'

    status updates: insert into repair_updates; if Completed → allow receipt_create

    receipt: insert into receipts; create payments row (Pending)

    customer marks payment: update payments with method, status='Paid', paid_at=NOW()

    return device: set appointments.returned_at=NOW(); requests.state='Returned'

    edge: No-Show → set appointments.no_show=1; requests.state='No-Show'

    on hold: insert update status='On Hold' (customer sees in tracker)

UI placement (no frameworks, very simple)

    Customer dashboard:

        “New Request” form

        “Proposed Slots” list (Accept button)

        “My Tracker” (current status timeline)

        “Completed” (view receipt, leave feedback)

        “Payments” (mark Online/Cash)

    Technician assign_and_propose.php (single page):

        Left table: Unassigned “New” requests (filter where state='New')

        On click row: small form (slot1/slot2/slot3) + Assign to me + Propose → POST

        Below: My proposals waiting (for info)

    Technician accepted_appointments.php:

        Cards/rows with: chosen_slot, Device Received / No-Show, Status select, Create Receipt, Payment status, Mark Returned, Feedback link

    Admin: keep only registrations approval + reports + disable/enable users + feedback views.
